#### Motivation
- Too many apps out there but none fulfills my expectation about a finance management app
- Too many apps out there are setting too high of a barrier to afford the service
- Too many apps out there are only for mobile or for web, never both

#### Goals
1. Creating an app that manages both personal finances and bill spliting with others
2. Letting users and their group pick a cloud service of their choice (eg: GDrive, OneDrive, or even Supabase)
3. Creating a cross-platform app using Flutter
